# mandelbrot-js
Mandelbrot Set Explorer
---

Just playing with JavaScript.

Extensible, chunk-based, canvas(html5) rendering system with zooming and dragging.

Mandelbrot set example (simple iteration-based coloring): [http://azureblue.github.io/mandelbrot-js]. Use mouse wheel for zooming, left-click to center, drag for moving, right-click for settings.

A fairly new web browser version is required.
